## ADD

ADD is same as copy. It is used to copy the files from local to the container/image.
But it has two extra uses

1. ADD can download the file directly fromm internet
2. ADD can untar/unzip the file directly into the container.

FROM almalinux:8

ADD https://example.com/myarchive.tar.gz /app/


If the source is a URL and it ends with .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .tar.xz, it is automatically unpacked into the destination directory.

FROM almalinux:8

ADD https://example.com/myfile.txt /app/

You can copy files directly from a remote URL.
