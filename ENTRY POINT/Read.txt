ENTRYPOINT
This is also used to run the container. But there are few differences.
1. We can't over-ride the entry point but we can over-ride the CMD.
2. We can't over-ride the entry point if we try to do so it will go and append the entrypoint command.
3. If you use CMD and Entrypoint and don't give any command from terminal, CMD acts as argument provider to Entrypoint.
