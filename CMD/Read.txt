## CMD
CMD is an instruction that runs the container. It should run in the foreground and it should run for infinite time.

RUN vs CMD

RUN will be executed at the time of image creation.
CMD will be executed at the time of the container creation.

If we give multiple CMD the last one will be considered.

Ex: FROM centos:7
    RUN yum install nginx -y
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    CMD ["sleep", "20"]

from above example, it will consider CMD ["sleep", "20"]
