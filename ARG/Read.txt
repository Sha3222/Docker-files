## ARG

ARG is used to supply the variable during the time of the image creation.

ARG is the only instruction used before the FROM.

ARG declared before the FROM can not be access after the FROM
lets see the example:

ARG VERSION
FROM almalinux: ${VERSION: -8}
RUN echo ${version} >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Here I can't access the ARG variable.


This allows the users to customise the built process without changing the built file.

Example:

FROM almalinux:latest
ARG a=default_value
RUN echo "${a}"


command: docker build --build-arg a=Hi -t <image-name>:version .
